# iceage
During the last two million years, a series of ice ages has occurred, during which large ice sheets have grown, principally on the northern hemisphere land masses [1]. Late Pleistocene ice ages occurred with some regularity, with a period of 100,000 years over the last 450,000 years. I have investigated the full 2-million-year Pleistocene climate model using the model proposed by [2].

In this model, a bifurcation can occur with the following two possibilities: [2]
a) the early Pleistocene as a steady state, or b) free oscillatory behavior in both the eary and late Pleistocene
